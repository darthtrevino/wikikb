# WikiKB

WikiKB is an efficient, retrieval-backed knowledge base for humans and agents, stored in a GitHub repository's wiki. Content can be ingested or queried from the command line, through GitHub Issues, or as an agent skill.

An LLM provider is not required to ingest content, or to search the knowledge base. A local, model-free LexCAT BM25 engine runs entirely on CPU, either on the client machine or within GitHub Actions.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) operations, such as summarization and question-answering, can use any configured AI provider.

## Install

### Agent-guided (recommended)

Give this prompt to your coding agent:

```text
Install WikiKB using https://github.com/githubnext/wikikb/blob/main/INSTALL.md
```

The agent confirms a target repository, enables and initializes its GitHub Wiki, installs the CLI and workflows, and verifies a real retrieval. It will stop for approval before repository or settings changes.

### Manual

Requires Node.js 22.5.0+, Git, GitHub CLI, an initialized GitHub Wiki, and a configured Git author for writes.

```bash
npm ci
bash tools/wikikb-local/install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
export WIKIKB_GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
```

The manual installer places a checkout-backed launcher in `~/.local/bin`; `WKB_INSTALL_DIR` changes the destination. The release includes the LexCAT executables for linux/x64, darwin/arm64, and win32/x64. Other platforms must set `WIKIKB_LEXCAT_BIN` to an operator-approved executable.

### GitHub CLI extension

The release includes a `gh-wikikb` extension launcher. Publish or mirror this
repository as `githubnext/gh-wikikb` (GitHub CLI requires the `gh-` repository
prefix), then install and run it as `gh wikikb`:

```bash
gh extension install githubnext/gh-wikikb --pin main
gh wikikb --help
```

Install the WikiKB agent skill for the current user:

```bash
gh wikikb skills install
```

This writes `~/.agents/skills/wikikb-memory/SKILL.md` and its agent metadata. Existing changed files are preserved unless `--force` is provided.

## Use

```bash
wkb add ai-research owner/repository
wkb ai-research sync
wkb ai-research search "hybrid retrieval methods" --top 5
wkb ai-research query "How does graph-based retrieval differ from keyword search?" --no-ai
```

Here, `ai-research` is the local name registered for `owner/repository`. The
`search` command returns the five best-matching wiki entries. The `query` command
retrieves evidence for the question and prints that evidence without asking an
AI model to synthesize an answer.

Dots after the registered name select namespace slices. This example stores a
paper note under the `papers.transformers` slice, then searches only that slice
rather than the entire wiki:

```bash
wkb ai-research.papers.transformers ingest ./attention-is-all-you-need.md --tag paper,transformers
wkb ai-research.papers.transformers search "positional encoding" --top 5
```

Namespaces can have different purposes. This example archives up to 50 GitHub
issues from an open-source research tool under `sources.tool-discussions`,
without mixing them into the paper-notes slice, then searches only those issue
discussions:

```bash
wkb ai-research.sources.tool-discussions ingest-issues tool-owner/tool-repository --state all --limit 50 --comments
wkb ai-research.sources.tool-discussions search "ranking quality" --top 10
```

Finally, retrieve relevant entries from the whole `ai-research` wiki and
generate a topic summary with the configured AI provider. `--show-prompt` displays the
exact retrieved context and instructions without making an AI call; `--ai` sends
that prompt to the configured provider:

```bash
wkb ai-research summarize "Summarize the main approaches to retrieval-augmented generation" --show-prompt
wkb ai-research summarize "Summarize the main approaches to retrieval-augmented generation" --ai
```

Run `wkb --help` for options.

## Retrieval And Cache

WikiKB uses the local LexCAT model-free lexical BM25 indexing and retrieval backend, distributed as checksum-verified platform binaries.

Generated indexes are stored as bounded, checksum-verified archives on the wiki repository's parentless `wikikb-cache-v1` branch. The cache branch contains no wiki Markdown. Reads sync, restore a compatible index, or build and publish one. Offline work stays local and retries later; `--no-push` content never enters the shared cache.

AI generation is optional and uses the configured provider and model. Use `search`, or `query --no-ai`, for retrieval without generation. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Agentic Workflows

WikiKB can optionally install six GitHub Agentic Workflows controlled through labeled issues: `kb-ingest` and `kb-remember` write; `kb-question` and `kb-search` retrieve; `kb-lint` and `kb-explore` maintain.

Workflow source files live beside generated `*.lock.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`. Edit Markdown sources, then run `gh aw compile` and `gh aw validate`.

## Security

Treat all ingested content as untrusted. Prefer a private repository for every knowledge base: content may be confidential, can remain in Git history after deletion, and can contain prompt-injection attempts.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run release:check
```

The live suite is documented in [Integration Tests](tests/integration/README.md). The supported artifact contains only the CLI, Agentic Workflows, approved runtime binaries, and supporting source. WikiKB source is MIT-licensed; the vendored LexCAT binaries are distributed under separate terms.
